Jave Yoshimoto is an Asian-American painter whose work explores social issues and identity in detailed, graphic paintings.  Merging harsh reality with fantasy, Yoshimoto’s work often depicts environmental crises and natural disasters alongside mythical creatures in vibrant color. In an age of constant information, Yoshimoto aims to preserve and draw attention to the tragedies caused by climate change before they get washed away in the news cycle. 

Editor’s note: Particularly striking to me is Yoshimoto’s painting Numinous Lethologica, a gory depiction of modern whale and dolphin hunting. Behind a foreground of blood and animal carcasses, Godzilla turns away and screams helplessly toward the sky-- a dark giant of hopelessness in direct contrast to the piece’s colorful, psychedelic character.
