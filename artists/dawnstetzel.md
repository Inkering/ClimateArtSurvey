Dawn Stetzel is a multimedia artist and sculptor that creates pieces in conversation with specific environments. As stated in their artist statement in 2019, they create works which, “might feel somehow desolate to me, vast, or lonely due to environmental neglect.” For Stetzel, exploring these regions is simultaneously a practice of the future, examining new ways of living, and also of introspection, looking at inner tension amongst environmental destruction.

Editor’s note: What strikes me about Stetzel’s work is the deft and nimble movements throughout aesthetics and climate commentary. Although composed of found materials, their work shows an extreme attention to both the “glue” connecting waste items and to maintaining distinct and visceral imagery of pollution. - Dieter
