Toronto artist Tamara Lindeman didn’t set out to make a band about climate change, but with new album ignorance, the band name and topic became homogeneousI. Having spent the last few years diving deep into climate change, she released a set of songs to address climate grief with compassion.

Editor’s note: This new album is a real evolution (get it?) from Lindeman’s previous work which makes for  a fresh and lush soundscape. Biting yet soothing, it is as much a response to climate change itself as to her journey in studying it.
