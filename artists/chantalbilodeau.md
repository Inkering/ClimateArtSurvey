After a 2007 trip to Alaska, playwright Chantal Bilodeau was inspired to create climate change-focused work that would “bear witness to disruptions that are so massive that we will be still struggling to comprehend them for years to come.” She believes strongly in the ability of theater and storytelling to affect societal beliefs and values, and is currently working on a series of eight plays looking at the changes underway in each of the eight Arctic states.

Editor’s note: Bilodeau’s  one-act play It Starts With Me explores the relationship between the patriarchy and climate change. Although the performance I watched was less than three minutes long, I was moved by the way Bilodeau paired the oft-overlooked humanitarian issues created by climate change with  thundering, energetic chanting. It was a stunning reminder that we can’t afford to ignore our environmental crises.
