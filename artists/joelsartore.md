Joel Sartore is a National Geographic nature photographer dedicated to documenting and preserving animal species by taking intimate studio portraits and slowly building a “photo ark”. Through this work, they aim to raise attention for nearly extinct animals and to promote environmental activism.

Editor’s note: While other nature photographers focus on animals in situ, Sartore is an expert at bringing the species to the forefront. Their novel photography method and prolific work speaks for itself as a resounding call for avoiding extinction. I love how their work captures compassion inspiring gazes with tack sharpness. -Dieter
