Erica Daborn is a fine artist from England and currently living in Mexico who, at the moment, is crafting intricate yet massive murals depicting global climate issues we all face together. Titled, “Dialogues with Mother Earth,” the newest murals form a critically acclaimed series of charcoal pieces. Daborn is an expert and previously a teacher of drawing techniques, and thinks of climate activism as a natural course through which to give meaning to her traditional craft.

Editor’s Note: In S.O.S (Save our Seeds), Daborn presents a visual order reminiscent of botanical drawings at a massive scale. People in the work are each holding numerous seeds of disproportionate size, dearly protecting them from the deep sea like a biblical ark. S.O.S highlights a rarely discussed consequence of our new industrial farming economy, whose genetically modified seeds, however necessary they may be, lead to the odd and distributing patenting of an element of natural order. Companies such as Montsanto are able to patent their modified seeds, leading to the concept of illegal planting. Daborn, in turn, conducts a striking and pointed critique of this industrial structure.
